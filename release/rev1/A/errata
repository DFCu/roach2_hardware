* PPC Address Line[5:7] require pullups with 3k3
The PPC does not boot reliably without pullups on PERADDR5, 6 and 7.

* Sync Output Buffer feedback resistor values too high
Need to replace with close to 1k

* Sync Output Buffer need note on schematic to indicate not for clocks
The device gets way too hot with continous signals, need to say so on schematic

* DDR3 SPD address (0x50) clashes with U16.
Need to remove R378 and R379 to have U16 work as expected. SPD address should change to 0x57 in next rev. (Possibly via pullups)

* Green Status LEDs not evenly spaced
DS23,29,24 and 25 need to be nudged to align nicely
