* PPC Address Line[5:7] require pullups with 3k3
 The PPC does not boot reliably without pullups on PERADDR5, 6 and 7.

* Sync Output Buffer feedback resistor values too high
Need to replace with close to 1k

* Sync Output Buffer need note on schematic to indicate not for clocks
The device gets way too hot with continous signals, need to say so on schematic

(* Sync output to support clocks)

* DDR3 SPD address (0x50 and 0x18) clashes with U16.
Need to remove R378 and R379 to have U16 work as expected. SPD address should be '110' [ 0x56 and 0x1e ] in next rev. (Possibly via pullups)

* Green Status LEDs not evenly spaced (also v6 leds)
DS23,29,24 and 25 need to be nudged to align nicely

* QDR ODT should selectable via a pullup to either high or low.

* CPLD PORn/POR_FORCEn can break JTAG chain
Should remove POR_FORCEn and tie PORn with 3K3

* Scrap warm start jumper/circuit

* 1uF - 2.2uF on 1V5 inhibit to support renesas parts

* U40 has via on pin1 marking
cover the via

* MAX16071 EN pin should be pulled to 3v3 not 5V

* MAX16071 pinout is wrong (a la the datasheet)
need to move pins 34:38 to 33:37 and leave 38 NC

* ATX POWER ok to FTDI chip
this will make testing a little more convenient, suggest D2 (pin 53)

* PPC drives killn low when shutdown, which interferes the reset button.
This could hopefully be masked with a switch before the push-button controller

* current sense amplifaction too large in all cases but 3v3.
Need to reduce gain by a factor of 4 (roughly) by selecting gain resistors accordingly

* PPC USB oscillator not reliable need to investigate

* Backpowering on ALL FTDI signals to PPC, current switch workaround not working
